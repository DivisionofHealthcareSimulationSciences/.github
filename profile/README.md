### The Division of Healthcare Simulation Science (HCSS) 

Promotes a shared mission, "to improve the health of the public through simulation science." Healthcare simulation at its core, exists to improve the safety, effectiveness, efficiency, and quality of healthcare delivery.

The establishment of the Division allows for continued growth of the program at a new level, including the creation of a formal academic structure that in partnership with clinical/home departments will enhance opportunities to recruit, retain, and support mechanisms for faculty appointments. It will also support and provide interested faculty with opportunities to build their academic careers on the ground floor of this emerging science through recognition of partnerships with other adjacent areas of study (e.g., bioengineering, education, etc.). Along these lines, and as a next logical step, we are poised for future expansion of educational and research offerings, including exploration of degree granting programs to further the mission.
